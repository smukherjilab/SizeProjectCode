# SizeProjectCode

Here's the code that we used throughout the project "Robust organelle size control via bursty growth"

Code1.0 was written during projects
Code2.0 has the same pipeline, but improved & with additional features 

Code2.0 is recommended

(MATLAB scripts & supporting functions that compute single-cell measurements. Original purpose: compute number and size of organelles at the single-cell level, then aggregate data for population-level analyses)
