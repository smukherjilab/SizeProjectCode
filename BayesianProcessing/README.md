# image-processing
Image processing functions and scripts I've written for a biophysics lab @MukherjiLab

For code I originally used during the project check out SizeControlProjectCode

For newer code (mostly written during rebuttal) check out ProcessingWorkflow. I named it that because it should be a self-contained archive of all the code I use to go from (deconvolved) raw image data to organelle statistics.
