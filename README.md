# SizeProjectCode

Here's the code that we used throughout the project "Robust organelle size control via bursty growth"

(MATLAB scripts & supporting functions that compute single-cell measurements. Original purpose: compute number and size of organelles at the single-cell level, then aggregate data for population-level analyses)
