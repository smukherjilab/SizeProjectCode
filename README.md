# image-processing
Image processing functions and scripts

For code I originally used during the project check out SizeControlProjectCode

For newer code (mostly written during rebuttal) check out ProcessingWorkflow. I named it that because it should be a self-contained archive of all the code I use to go from (deconvolved) raw image data to organelle statistics. If you wanna analyze some images, I'd start here.
